# 🔰Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
<p>
  Morph is a project that aims to create a program that "morphs" any type of file to any other type of file. 
  
  The project is just starting, so it only has a few types of conversions, but I plan to add more over time. I'm a physics student, so I don't have much time during the week and will be working on this on weekends.

# 🚀 Getting started <a name="getting_started"></a>
For now the program is literally just a python script and i think i will be changing that, so these may change a lot in a few months (today is 10/11/2025)

### Requirements
- Python interpreter (to run the script)
- [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) (audio converter)
- [POPPLER](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) (dock converter)

### Instalation 
1. Add FFMPEG's and POPPLER's bin folders to the environment variable PATH (video on how to below)
2. Download this repo as a ZIP file from GitHub.
3. Run the script with any python interpreter, i think the easiest to install is the [official Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
